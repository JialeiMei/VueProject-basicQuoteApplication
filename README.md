# vue-project-2

A very basic little application built with Vue.js with quasar framework. - 02

We start with a quote and then we can add a new quote like in grid, so once we add it, we get 2 of 10 and the quote is added. Now if I add a couple of other quotes here until we reach 10 quotes there, when try to add the 11th one, I get an error that I should first delete some quotes so that we're not getting too crowded here. Well I can delete quotes by simply clicking on them and then you see it updates up there and I can start adding new ones again.
